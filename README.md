PortalHubCirnoDayo
===================

A minimal single-page site showing a header (navigation bar) with a centered website name, realtime time on the left, and realtime date on the right. The theme uses blue/cyan colors and Bootstrap for styling.

Files
- `index.html` — Main page. Contains the navigation bar, theme CSS, and JavaScript that updates time and date every second.

How to open

Option 1 — Open directly in the browser (simplest):
- Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser via File → Open File.

Option 2 — Run a local HTTP server (recommended for some browser features):
- If you have Python installed, run this in PowerShell in the project folder:

```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Behavior
- The left side of the navbar shows the current time (HH:MM:SS), updated every second.
- The center shows the website name `PortalHub`.
- The right side shows the current date (e.g. Friday, October 3, 2025), updated every second.

Notes
- The rest of the site content will be added later as requested.
- The page uses Bootstrap CDN; an internet connection is required to load Bootstrap from the CDN.
